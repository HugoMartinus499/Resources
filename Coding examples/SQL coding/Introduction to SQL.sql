-- SELECT statement is to select the columns, * means all columns
-- FROM statement is to select the database
-- LIMIT statement is to limit number of rows
-- Always use a ; when executing and statements should be capital letters
-- ORDER BY should always go between FROM and LIMIT, 
-- ORDER BY sorts in ascending order, add DESC to sort in descending order
-- ASC to sort in ascending order, order is determined by what it is next to
-- WHERE statement goes after FROM but before ORDER BY, it is a filtering statement
-- WHERE statement can also be used for non-numeric, just a ' on either side eg. 'Company Name'
-- AS statement can be used to name columns created as a result of arithmetic procedures
-- LIKE statement can be used in conjunction with WHERE to filter for partial filters
-- Using a wildcard like '%' in LIKE statement informs search, 
    -- % before string searches for any number of characters before string, ie. "ends with"
    -- % after string searches for any number of characters after string, ie. "starts with"
    -- % before and after string searches for number of characters before and after, ie. "contains"
-- IN statement can be used in conjunction with WHERE to filter for multiple identifiers, works like "is one of"
-- NOT statement is great in conjunction with LIKE and IN to find all registrations not fitting criteria, works like "is not"
-- AND and BETWEEN  operators are good for intervals and stacking filters
-- OR is great for finding differences in the data, can be used with all other operators using parentheses to stack filters
-- JOIN is used with ON to pull data from multiple tables, ON is used to determine what columnn is used to JOIN the tables
-- Aliases can be used to not have to type out long table names, can be done with the AS statement or with just a space after the name and then the alias
-- It is important to name columns, otherwise they might fuse together when joining
-- LEFT and RIGHT JOIN are effectively interchangable. If the right table contains extra rows, the query can be switched around so the right table is now the left table
-- Filtering using an AND clause when also using LEFT JOIN instead of the WHERE joins all rows but only populates the field of the AND clause when the filter is met
-- NULL occurs most often when data is missing or after a LEFT JOIN, where some rows don't fit the criteria and are therefore not populated
-- Agregate functions should be written after SELECT statement and the following field should be in brackets
-- COUNT function returns number of 
-- COUNT function does not include NULL fields
-- SUM function sums values, can therefore only be used for numeric fields. NULL is treated as 0
-- MIN and MAX can be used on all operators, it returns lowest or highest numeric value, earliest or latest date and closest to A in the alphabet or closest to Z in the alphabet
-- AVG function ignores NULLs, so if NULLS need to be 0, the average must be hardcoded using arithmetic and SUM and COUNT
-- Mean is calculated in SQL using the AVG function, Mode and Median is a bit tricky
-- GROUP BY can be used to aggregate data within subsets of the data. For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives
-- The GROUP BY always goes between WHERE and ORDER BY.
-- Any column in the SELECT statement that is not within an aggregator must be in the GROUP BY clause.
-- DISTINCT can be used instead of COUNT and the GROUP BY clause. It works like Number of Unique. NOTE: it can slow down the query significantly when using aggregation
-- HAVING is used as an alternative to the WHERE clause, when filtering on a part of the query that has been created using an aggregate
-- HAVING goes between the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses
-- DATE_TRUNC allows you to truncate your date to a particular part of your date-time column. Common trunctions are day, month, and year. 
-- DATE_PART can be useful for pulling a specific portion of a date, but notice pulling month or day of the week (dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years in order. Rather you are grouping for certain components regardless of which year they belonged in.
-- GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses can reference the columns in the SELECT statement with numbers that follow the order they appear in, in the SELECT statement
-- CASE statements work as ifelse, they follow the syntax: CASE WHEN {event} THEN {outcome} ELSE {different outcome} and must end with END
-- The ELSE statement is optional and when not used, returns NULL
-- CASE statements can be stacked, so as many as you would liked can be used in conjunction before ending with END
-- CASE statements can be used with conditional operators like WHERE, AND and OR
-- Subquerys are tools for performing operations in multiple steps
-- Subquerys need to have aliases, which are added after the parenthesis
-- Use identation to make the querys easier to read, especially as they get progressively more complex
-- Subquerys can be used anywhere a table name might be used
-- WITH can be used to better readability
-- WITH should be defined in the beginning before the outer query
-- When creating multiples tables with WITH, you add a comma after every new table, except for the last one leading into the main query
-- new tables are aliased using "table_name AS" and then the query between parentheses
-- Data cleaning is useful to structure messy data
-- LEFT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the beginning (or from the left). As you saw here, you can pull the first three digits of a phone number using LEFT(phone_number, 3).
-- RIGHT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the end (or from the right). As you saw here, you can pull the last eight digits of a phone number using RIGHT(phone_number, 8).
-- LENGTH provides the number of characters for each row of a specified column. Here, you saw that we could use this to get the length of each phone number as LENGTH(phone_number).
-- POSITION takes a character and a column, and provides the index where that character is for each row. The index of the first position is 1 in SQL. 
-- If you come from another programming language, many begin indexing at 0. Here, you saw that you can pull the index of a comma as POSITION(',' IN city_state).
-- STRPOS provides the same result as POSITION, but the syntax for achieving those results is a bit different as shown here: STRPOS(city_state, ',').
-- Note, both POSITION and STRPOS are case sensitive, so looking for A is different than looking for a.
-- Therefore, if you want to pull an index regardless of the case of a letter, you might want to use LOWER or UPPER to make all of the characters lower or uppercase.
-- If names are stored in separate columns could be combined together to create a full name: CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) or with piping as first_name || ' ' || last_name.
-- CAST can change the data type
-- TO_DATE can convert text date to number date, like january to 1
-- SUBSTR can be used to extract a substring from a string, following this syntax: SUBSTR(start position, number of characters extracted)
-- COALESCE can replace NULL values
-- The WINDOW clause can be used to create an alias for a window used in many different aggregations
-- LAG and LEAD clauses can be used to check previous(LAG) and next(LEAD) rows
-- NTILE function is used to specify percentiles. So NTILE(100) is percentage, NTILE(4) is quartile. The number is the number of parts to split into
-- UNION only appends distinct values. More specifically, when you use UNION, the dataset is appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped. 
-- If you’d like to append all the values from the second table, use UNION ALL. You’ll likely use UNION ALL far more often than UNION.
-- EXPLAIN entered before the query, to see the steps in running the query and using this to optimize it
